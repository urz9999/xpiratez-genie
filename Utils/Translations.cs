		{"STR_MEDIUM_SCOUT_UFOPEDIA", "A small non-combat vessel that poses little threat to your craft. Used by Academicians and Traders in most missions. The crew ranges from 5 to 10 members, half of them civilian.{NEWLINE}Max DPM: 39"},
		{"STR_LARGE_SCOUT_UFOPEDIA", "A general purpose vessel used by Academicians and Traders for more demanding missions. It can hold a crew of 7 to 19, always including an Engineer. Mostly harmless.{NEWLINE}Max DPM: 52"},
		{"STR_HARVESTER_UFOPEDIA", "Aptly named, the Shrine Ship is the primary vessel of the Church, and is sometimes commanded by a Reverend or even a Cardinal. It can hold a crew as small as 11 or as big as 31, armed with laser weapons and flamethrowers.{NEWLINE}ARMOR: 10; SHIELDS: 200 (Reg x1); Max DPM: 172"},
		{"STR_ABDUCTOR_UFOPEDIA", "Although not really a warship, this vessel represents an elite level of technology and holds elite crew, so it's better not underestimated. It is normally used for special missions.{NEWLINE}SHIELDS: 500 (Reg x3); Max DPM: 175"},
		{"STR_TERROR_SHIP_UFOPEDIA", "This is just a large dropship. Its weapons might not be the most powerful around, but it is armored and can take a lot of punishment. However, shooting it down will grant a lot of infamy.{NEWLINE}ARMOR: 5; Max DPM: 156"},
		{"STR_BATTLESHIP_UFOPEDIA", "The Cruiser is amongst the largest and most powerful craft around, manned by the best-equipped personnel. To make things even worse, it was designed with boarding actions in mind and can be used to assault our Hideouts directly.{NEWLINE}ARMOR: 25; Max DPM: 291"},
		{"STR_SUPPLY_SHIP_UFOPEDIA", "Supply Ships are used to fly regular supply runs to enemy Secret Bases. They are fast and hard to get once they manage to get close to their Base, but should yield significant booty (especially Hellerium) with only moderate risk, if we work fast - they're rigged to explode."},
		{"STR_SUPPLY_SHIP_LOST", "We'll meet again,{NEWLINE}Don't know when,{NEWLINE}Don't know where,{NEWLINE}We'll meet again..."},
		{"STR_ACCESS_LIFT_UFOPEDIA", "The access lift is the kernel of any Hideout. It's an easy guess as to what it does. Or so I hope. OK. It allows access - to both welcome and unwelcome guests. Especially the rude kind who, when you ignore the doorbell, blow the door out. It cannot be made fully secure, though, as we need the traffic of workers and thralls who live aboveground.{NEWLINE}Provides 25 storage space, initially for construction equipment.{NEWLINE}Refreshment: 1"},
		{"STR_CORRIDOR_UFOPEDIA", "A simple 4-way passage with a central chamber, can be built to link outlying parts of a Hideout to the piping and power grid. It also grates off the sewers, making them impassable to enemies. It is equipped with a monitoring camera. To build more Corridors, we'll need to learn something about Electrics and Electronics."},
		{"STR_FIRE_PIT_UFOPEDIA", "Anyone who carelessly strolls into this seemingly normal corridor will trigger firebombs hidden in its walls. Even if they don't roast the trespasser, they'll make them pause for a moment at least. Warning: the fuses aren't infallible and sometimes they'll fail to arm immediately."},
		{"STR_GAS_CHAMBER_UFOPEDIA", "This room is equipped with hidden bombs, releasing powerful sleeping gas when someone walks close to them. Capturing prisoners has never been so easy, unless they wear gas masks, that is."},
		{"STR_BEE_HIVE_UFOPEDIA", "Not many things from the zones are as universally infamous as uberbees. These cutesy insects will happily spend their lives gathering nectar from your Plantations and processing it into uberhoney, which can be sold for uberca- for cash. To facilitate their movement to and fro, special tunnels are built between the apiary and the farm, but don't be surprised if you see them buzzing around the living areas. They will generally ignore other hideout dwellers since they are familiar with their scent, but should their hives be disturbed by strangers, the bees will surely go medieval on their asses!{NEWLINE}Max. 1 per Hideout."},
		{"STR_HYDROPONICS_UFOPEDIA", "With the help of the local farmers, and with the understanding of our Hideout's ecosystem, we have devised how to grow plants underground for food and profit. The well-known Zone plant, Uber Wheat, will be an ideal crop, it will grow fast on our Hellerium sludge, thus providing us with $100k monthly earnings. The humble Uber Wheat has many uses: it can be distilled into alcohol, fed to mutated Reapers (and to mutate Reapers), baked into Uber Bread and all sorts of delicious pastry! The flour is also very very explosive. It is possible we might learn more advanced forms of farming in the future..."},
		{"STR_HYDROPONICS_WEED_HARVEST_UFOPEDIA", "Automation of lighting and watering allowed (alloweed?) us to master the growing of a notoriously difficult, yet very useful plant - the Sectoweed. Farming ain't for dumbheads and needs following certain steps:{NEWLINE}1) Construct Sectoweed Plantation, this needs 12 Sectoweed. It can be either constructed anew, or on top of an existing Plantation, the latter saves us $80k.{NEWLINE}2) When ready, 'Dismantle' it to change water and light regimen, fostering second phase of growth. This will cost $25k.{NEWLINE}3) When fully grown, 'Dismantle' again to harvest (costs $5k). This will net us 240 Sectoweed and leave behind a standard Plantation."},
		{"STR_HYDROPONICS_BOOM_HARVEST_UFOPEDIA", "Growing Boom Fruit is challenging, as we need to make sure it doesn't blow the whole place up. This means higher costs and the need for stronger walls.{NEWLINE}1) Construct Boom Plantation, this needs 10 Boom Fruit & 10 Hellerium. It can be either constructed anew, or on top of an existing Plantation, the latter saves us $80k.{NEWLINE}2) When ready, 'Dismantle' it as normal, $50k cost.{NEWLINE}3) When fully grown, 'Dismantle' again to harvest (costs $10k). This will net us 100 Boom Fruit and leave behind a standard Plantation."},
		{"STR_BODY_FARM_UFOPEDIA", "This facility is required by all the processes related to Body Swapping. Additionally, it can produce the resources we need via harvest cycles. The cycle goes as follows: build a Body Farm, then dismantle it to receive 50 Zombie Juice and 10 Living Blood. You are left with Body Farm (Empty). You can reconstruct a new Body Farm over it, in which case you will get 49 Life Support Systems back.{NEWLINE}Requires 50 Life Support Systems to be constructed.{NEWLINE}Provides Medical, Cloning and Body Swap functions.{NEWLINE}During Hideout Defense, it will activate a self-defense routine, waking 6 special half-zombie corpses called B-Farm Defenders."},
		{"STR_CASINO_UFOPEDIA", "A temple to human vice, built in cooperation with Jack. He funds the prizes and does the marketing, in exchange for half of the profits. The other half, however, is still a lot. What's more, this cooperation means we can exchange Neutronium Casino Coupons for prizes here! Only one Casino can be built per Hideout, and establishing it requires a substantial amount of Credit Chips: 1 Obsidian, 6 Gold, 36 Silver, 216 Purple, 1296 Blue and 7776 Red. It will also cost 666 Glamour."},
		{"STR_GAMBLING_UFOPEDIA", "Jack is running a major gambling gig, so we figured out a foolproof plan: bring his slot machines to our Mess Halls and get rich! A play costs one $1000 Chip, and might grant us either a random Credit Chip, a fruit, some other trinket, or a Coupon of varied value. Highest tier coupons can only be claimed at Casino."},
		{"STR_STILL_UFOPEDIA", "A masterpiece of technology, a symbol of triumph of mind over matter, a place of happiness. All in one, albeit a bit smelly, facility. Without it present on-site, a Hideout cannot produce any alcoholic beverages. In addition to providing this functionality, it provides workspace for 5 Runts, but with no Workshops present, you can use it only to make alcohol. Requires an Extractor to be present.{NEWLINE}Building a new Still will require the Alchemy technology."},
		{"STR_ONSEN_UFOPEDIA", "The healing qualities of hot springs are well known; it is ridiculous that we didn't realize their full potential earlier, despite sitting on a literal treasure trove of hot, healthy, glowing sludge! Add to this an almost equally healthy, mind-liberating atmosphere of Sectoweed fumes, and we have a facility which not only improves recovery rate of everyone in the Hideout by 0.5% of their max HP daily, and Refreshment rate to 10, but also serves as a cultural center! They say you shouldn't play or swim in the Onsen, but we're no dumb Sky Ninjas and can also use the Onsen as a small training center (up to 6 Hands)."},
		{"STR_LUXURY_SPA_UFOPEDIA", "Besides the huge swimming pool (yaaay!), this facility contains all sorts of entertainment, recreational and training improvements: a fighting ring, a games terrace (with a great view), an arcade room, a sauna and more. It not only allows 60 hands to improve their physical fitness, but might be useful for training our auxilia as well, and generally increases the civilizational and sanitational level of a Hideout, thus improving wounds recovery by 0.65% of Max HP daily and Refreshment to 15. Dress code of this facility says 'the less, the better', a Swimsuit is the maximum allowed. Only a single Spa is allowed per Hideout.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 4 Slaves and 6 Slave Maids."},
		{"STR_VIP_CLUB_UFOPEDIA", "The school was never your strong side, but to reach the very top, you need to build a culture. There is however such a thing as physical culture, right? And you, Superstar, like physical culture in all aspects: carousing, fighting, dancing and sexual prowess!"},
		{"STR_VIP_CLUB_FAC_UFOPEDIA", "This 'dojo' makes money by luring VIPs and prospective prizefighting champions with various form of decadence: strippers, fights, alcohol and hot baths, not to mention your aura of an envied master, emanating from your personal office at the top floor. This charm is so strong that it can be used to extract slave contacts from its employees, if they happen to owe you their lives after a successful Hideout Defense. Furthermore, a Brainer can be secretly employed here to gather and analyze VIP gossip. During the day, the facility can be used by the crew, providing 16 training capacity and 8 Refreshment.{NEWLINE}One per Hideout. Requires Beast Den and Still present.{NEWLINE}Construction requires 240 Glamour."},
		{"STR_GYM_ROOM_UFOPEDIA", "This building houses a special, dangerous training course, which, aided by certain chemical substances, improves trainee's statistics on a daily basis. The facility consists of a shooting range (with targets that return fire), a boxing ring, some boring weights and last but not least, an arcade room! However, the course is very intensive and each Dojo can service only 12 Hands at a time. Wounded Hands do not benefit from the Dojo until fully healed. Dojo can't train stats past a certain threshold: 66 (Strength, Health, Throwing); 85 (TUs, Firing); 100 (Melee, Stamina). Reactions and Bravery aren't trained.{NEWLINE}The facility also boosts Hideout's Refreshment rate to 5."},
		{"STR_LIBRARY_UFOPEDIA", "This luxury facility is used to store all kinds of books, paper, crystal and electronic, romance, adventure, erotica and even an occasional arcane work. It can serve as a workplace for a single Brainer, but what's more important, it's absolutely required for some of the more fancy Research and Manufacture projects to be even possible. However, good books are hard to find and extremely expensive, so establishing such a place is a major expenditure (a waste of money, some would say).{NEWLINE}Max. 3 per Hideout. Refreshment: 4"},
		{"STR_GREAT_LIBRARY_UFOPEDIA", "Creation of such an exquisite place of learning would allow us to host no less than 23 knowledge-hungry Brainers, dedicated to uncovering all the secrets of nature, as the forever-elusive Nine Moons Sorceress desires. Her secrets in particular. However, this will be impossible without her blessings; a Scroll of the Night, which supposedly can be found at underground Lokk'Naar shrines. We will also need no less than 200 Pillow Books to create the body of dream knowledge.{NEWLINE}Provides VooDoo Skill training for 7 and Summoning function.{NEWLINE}Refreshment: 6"},
		{"STR_ASTROSENSORIUM_UFOPEDIA", "Guided by the knowledge of Witchery and Occult, we have devised this arcane facility to dabble deeper into Hyperwave Mysticism. The upper chamber allows for 3 Brainers to research secrets of the universe, and the lower hall allows for 4 adepts to work on improving their VooDoo skill.{NEWLINE}Max. 1 per base. Req. 333 Glamour to build.{NEWLINE}Can detect enemy Hideouts within 2800 NM range.{NEWLINE}Refreshment: 5"},
		{"STR_GDX_LAB_UFOPEDIA", "An advanced lab, built using Dr. X's knowledge (not as advanced as the ancient lab you have, though). Cannot be built without the Surgery Room technology, and only a single one can ever be built. Provides workspace for 10 Brainers."},
		{"STR_RED_TOWER_UFOPEDIA", "The place where the Red Mage dwells. Provides functionality of Lab, Library and Summoning Circle. Up to 5 Brainers can work here."},
		{"STR_BLACK_TOWER_UFOPEDIA", "With the genius of Dr. X, and a lots of help from our Brainers, the Red Mage was able to substantially improve the design of her tower. This tower has upgraded Brainer capacity to 8, and has a lot of additional functionalities: Mainframe, Biotech, Surgery, Power Plant.{NEWLINE}In addition, it can conceal our Hideout from sight (counts as 3 Shrouds) and lash out with powerful bolts of Mind energy at any invaders who weren't fooled by this.{NEWLINE}This facility requires Necronomicon, which can be obtained by dismantling the Red Tower."},
		{"STR_MESS_HALL_UFOPEDIA", "No Hideout is complete without this establishment! It serves fresh drinks from the Still (requires one to function), slightly increasing wound recovery speed of our Hands (especially those with high Health). It is also a cultural centre, providing a proper forum for public discussion (we're no longer limited to the Hangar!) and workspace for 1 Brainer; without it, many cultural advances and some mission opportunities will be impossible to research. Only a single Mess Hall can be built per Hideout.{NEWLINE}Can detect enemy Hideouts within 2000 NM range.{NEWLINE}Refreshment: 6"},
		{"STR_MESS_HALL_ADV_UFOPEDIA", "A Mess Hall of the space age! Self contained, comes with in-built Still (so the old Still can be gotten rid of), an underground swimming pool, and the Sensosphere technology to greatly improve the entertainment and training value. 2 Brainers can work there. Plasma Spitter installed as organic defense. Requires 10 Hypno Panels to be constructed. Only a single one allowed per Hideout.{NEWLINE}Can detect enemy Hideouts within 2000 NM range.{NEWLINE}8 training space. Refreshment: 12"},
		{"STR_HOTEL_UFOPEDIA", "The Brainers were calling you mad when you came up with the idea of starting hospitality industry! As a pirate! The secret is, you're just too lazy to come up with better ways of making easy money. A Hotel is a comfy, well-heated facility, providing gambling, cultural services, good food and electronic locks. It can house up to 50... guests, as well as 25 crew and 50 units of belongings. Its large onsen provides 12 training spaces and 9 daily Refreshment. Finally, enemy Hideouts can be detected within 2000 NM.{NEWLINE}A Hotel requires a Still present and 90 Glamour to be constructed."},
		{"STR_LOVE_CLINIC_UFOPEDIA", "Here, our Gals can be treated by the eager personnel, while eating great food to the fullest. This results in miraculous rates of recovery! (I also heard that the nurses savagely whip any patients who try to outstay their healing process; it serves these simulants well!). Some go there even when healthy, though... (+10 living space, Refreshment 6).{NEWLINE}Only a single building of this type is allowed per Hideout.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 600 Sectoweed."},
		{"STR_MED_BAY_UFOPEDIA", "A general medical facility that will speed up the wound recovery of all Hands in a Hideout - for a price. By healing an extra 0.5 HP per day, it effectively cuts the downtime by a third. Your Hands may complain that the recovery is being rushed, but they won't scoff at the company of nurses, instead of ol' tired faces in the bunkhouse. Only a single Sick Bay can be built per Hideout, but the health recovery bonus stacks with any bonuses provided by similar facilities (as if we know anything about this, ho, ho). Gives workspace for a single very eager Brainer.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 10 Medical Supplies."},
		{"STR_SURGERY_ROOM_UFOPEDIA", "This one requires a Library present to operate. Note the double meaning of the word, ha, ha. Anyhow. Various surgical procedures need such a specialized environment to be performed, allowing all wounded to recover extra 0.25 HP plus 1% of the soldier's Max HP daily, almost halving recovery times. This facility also houses 2 Brainers and 2 animal cages (for their subjects?). Only a single Surgery Room is allowed per Hideout.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 3 Surgery Units."},
		{"STR_METAGARDEN_UFOPEDIA", "This establishment houses highly mutated plants, growing on Hellerium sludge, which grant us multiple benefits:{NEWLINE}>POWER. The green energy generates less income than a full-fledged Power Station, has an equivalent functionality.{NEWLINE}>HEALING. Passive healing & Refreshment rate 9.{NEWLINE}>FOOD. By feeding the outside shantytown with tasty fruit, it creates a possibility to store additional 50 units of warez there.{NEWLINE}>DEFENSE. A special plant, the 'Tree of Life' allows detection of enemies (SENSE 18) and healing of our own. Additionally, facility's undergrowth is difficult to navigate.{NEWLINE}Only a single Metagarden per Hideout. 250 Sectoweed to build."},
		{"STR_CLONING_CENTRE_UFOPEDIA", "This building will enable us to grow all sorts of living matter, from organs to whole organisms. Even if we haven't devised any creatures yet, it will help with medical care, recovering 0.75 HP daily to all Hands present on-site. The power of Creation is now ours to command! Up to ten Runts can work in this facility. Required for 'Revive Sleeping Beauty' Project. Only a single Cloning Centre is allowed per Hideout."},
		{"STR_STUDY_ROOM_UFOPEDIA", "Some facilities are designed to give Brainers personal space to meditate; this one is the opposite. Equipped in the best media equipment our money can buy, it faciliates brainstorming and violent exchange of ideas (fistfights aren't that uncommon there). It has a capacity of 4 Brainers. However, a Hideout intended to house them first needs a Library (for references), a Cultural facility (like a Mess Hall), and a Still (to help with abstract thinking). Needed for School Graduation.{NEWLINE}Max. 1 per Hideout. Requires 350 Personal Databases."},
		{"STR_SPACE_RADIO_UFOPEDIA", "Previously, we could only listen to the hyperwave broadcasts, and even then only from the most powerful signal sources. Catgirls told us how to assemble a device that allows us to fully communicate with anyone, if we know the number of the galaxy in the spiral and the number of the planet in the tentura. This will allow us to get in touch with Nekomimi Govt, and also here we can listen to various entertainment broadcasts from outer planets and even acquaint the Universe with our amazing culture.

It's a better paid job, but a dirty one if there ever was; it entails dealing - permanently - with various nasty pests, from hostile fauna and flora to mutants. The Pest Control wear light, chem-resistant, flying suits to get where no one else can and are generally much more dangerous (and enthusiastic) than GOs, but their area of expertise isn't dealing with armed and organized opposition - like us."},

In actuality, the Osiron Yeomen think very little of the Academy, their duty being sworn to Osiron leaders instead. It's some sort of rite of passage they have to complete before being allowed to advance in the Osiron structure. Curiously enough, they show combat capabilities much above that of the Osiron Security cohorts, especially in melee, speed and Evasion. It seems Osiron is quite unwilling to share its best with the Academy."},

These young women are given clean, snazzy clothes to appreciate their new position and enough work and study to make them stop thinking about any life they had before the Academy took it. Seems that the lower your rank is in the Academy, the more work you need to do, since Students are used for virtually everything, from running endless errands to manning dangerous posts. They're too weak and unskilled for serious labour, though, so we can only enslave them."},
		{"STR_ACADEMY_NURSE_UFOPEDIA", "Nurses are beastmasters/healers/guards who help Academy teams during their humanitarian aid missions. They're trained to aggressively assume authority over bands of confused tribals, provide first aid and manhandle any mutant who refuses to be taken to Academy's hospital for healing and further screening. Nurses carry little of value, except for their pedantically cleaned clothing, which can be torn to get bandages."},
		{"STR_SECTOID_NAVIGATOR_UFOPEDIA", "Also called 'The Owls', they are armed people who accompany Academicians on away missions to protect them from things like us. Their combat prowess is rather poor, especially initiative - probably because of all the classes on wars and tactics they were forced to endure - but they get good weapons and carapace armor. Seems that they have somehow fallen from grace in Osiron and got relegated to such tasks. If you see them in battle, be careful as they can target people spotted by Drones or leaders."},

They are also known to experiment on humans and perhaps even kittens.

As for our gains, Medics' knowledge about mutants will be invaluable when searching for allies."},
		{"STR_SECTOID_ENGINEER_UFOPEDIA", "Engineers are common among the Academicians, as they're needed to maintain their ships, labs and other extravaganza.

They wear fancy power armor, light but protected by energy shields, and have a knack for constructing and using weird gizmos and bizarre weapons. Academy Scientists are both socially privileged and not quite right in their minds, the combined effects of which give them really good morale and general smugness."},

They move quickly and gracefully in their skin-tight jumpsuits (and not even any underwear to constrict them); they also enjoy the authority to enter any place. Thus they're liberated in both the literal and metaphorical sense. They employ powerful magics that attack the Charm resistance, making them master negotiators. They're also very hard to break, as they can control pain."},
		{"STR_ACADEMY_PIONEER_UFOPEDIA", "The ongoing losses have pushed the Academy to deploy their Espers-In-Training as shock troops, as well as to increase the enrollment rates and brainwashing intensity of the Astro Academies. Pioneers wear thin and smooth suits of Synthmuscle, extra hardened against all the filth of the world. The suits can of course fly and are equipped with enough sensors to make these young witches fast and dangerous opponents. As if this was not enough (because it isn't), they are protected by fast-regenerating Blue shields."},

Many of them are actually quite powerful and they consider themselves higher beings from us mortals, though they don't have the boobs to liken themselves to Star Gods. I'm sure we could sell this one for a nice pile of cash, but only after extracting all the information we can. Nevertheless, I'm not happy to have them in our hideout, not at all."},
		{"STR_SECTOID_COMMANDER_UFOPEDIA", "Provosts are capi di tutti capi in the Academy, the only ones to speak to Star Gods personally. They are chosen from among the Espers to lead them and are therefore extremely dangerous. Needless to say, they are very rare, well protected and possess terrible magical powers. Which doesn't mean we'll stop trying to capture more of them!"},
		{"STR_ACADEMY_THRALL_UFOPEDIA", "These men have been turned into playthings by Academy Counsellors. Apart from being used in the obvious way, they also act as guardians. Their constant diet of drugs and hormones makes them nearly zombie-like: resistant to pain, almost oblivious to the sense of danger, and physically imposing. We think we can switch their loyalties to have equally useful servants, but this can take some work..."},
		{"STR_CHURCH_SOLDIER_UFOPEDIA", "These Neophytes are mostly recruited from among the poor and forsaken, baited by the Reverends with promises of a better life. Then they get a nasty VooDoo treatment, which reinforces their warm feelings towards The Church and, by extension, Star Gods. Neophytes are still on the level of street urchins, but the Church is rich and provides them with good weapons."},
		{"STR_CHURCH_BOY_UFOPEDIA", "These very young men dutifully serve the Church's priesthood in all areas where being an adult is not a requirement. It is a bit regretful (and hurtful to our reputation) if we're forced to kill them, but maybe we don't have to, as they have no chance against our special skills, if you know what I mean, Cap'n. If all else fails, a stun baton would do as well."},
		{"STR_CHURCH_NAVIGATOR_UFOPEDIA", "This is what you get when you overdose a Neophyte with propaganda and other drugs: a Zealot. Zealots believe themselves to be directly controlled by the will of the Star Gods and, somehow, this makes them almost completely fearless. Despite their resolve and their fancy armor, they aren't as well-trained as professional soldiers, but they're fast and often compensate for their lack of accuracy by using the Church's trademark weapon: flamethrowers!"},
		{"STR_CHURCH_HANDMAID_UFOPEDIA", "The clergy would never tarnish their reputation by hiring servants off the street. The Shrine Maidens, while doing basically the same tasks, are well-paid and protected by their sacred status. They're skilled handmaids, performers and courtesans who, as the clergy says, can add a piece of celestial purity into even the dirtiest of mundane works."},
		{"STR_CHURCH_MAIDEN_UFOPEDIA", "The Church has an all-female order tasked with defense, called Maidens of War. Unlike Zealots, they're rarely used in offensive actions. Their origins are also different - unlike street urchins and assorted riffraff, the Maidens are recruited from the children of the Church's low level workers and Church-run orphanages. Maidens' training is centered on martial arts, but they seem to be pretty well educated in general. What we have caught is a low-level Maiden, and she seems to be more susceptible to our subtle coercion than many of the other, fanatical members of the Church.{NEWLINE}The armor Maidens wear is a customized version of a standard human Combat Armor, slightly more resistant to energy, but less to chem and piercing than normal, which seems to be a staple of all Church armors."},
		{"STR_CHURCH_ELITE_UFOPEDIA", "It is unbelievable that a human, even aided with a fancy refractor-equipped flying armor, can achieve such levels of physical performance. The Exalts not only can sustain enormous amounts of poison, exertion, pain or humiliation, they seem to actually enjoy it. These elite fighters also seem to be less block-headed than normal Zealots; they don't really revere the Star Gods at all. If anything, they narcissistically revere themselves. Seems that the inner circles of the Church are more into debauchery and self-indulgence than praying."},
		{"STR_BEASTMASTER_TERRORIST_UFOPEDIA", "Beastmasters are a special caste within The Church who tends to its critters. If you've seen those pets, you must have an idea on what their masters are like. They are smart, physically strong, daring and often a little wrong in the heads. Do not relax once you destroy their armor - the arcane circuitry on their underwear still dissipates laser energies very well and can even be used to deliver low-powered laser blasts. Better take them from behind, nay?"},
		{"STR_CHURCH_ENGINEER_UFOPEDIA", "The heavy armor of a Beastmaster shares the same base characteristics as Zealot's armor, although it is thicker, well-shielded and provides full enviro protection (fire & gas) - Beastmasters are much more valuable and usually leave attacking to their pets, so mobility is not required. The defining (and expensive) feature of this armor is its ablativeness - if the damage is too great to withstand, it explodes outwards, revealing a pretty much unharmed and very pissed Beastmaster."},
		{"STR_CHURCH_MATRON_UFOPEDIA", "Matrons are universally revered and respected officials and leaders within the Maidens of War order of the Church. Their duties are to run Maiden covens, but also various non-military establishments of the Church, from food handout centres to hospitals. Sometimes they also serve as special envoys for the Church. They're skilled melee fighters, diplomats, lore-keepers and healers. In short, these older women are jaded, sophisticated and kind of creepy so we'd better keep them separated from the rest of our population, who knows what kind of curses and love-magics they possess?"},
		{"STR_CHURCH_PRIEST_UFOPEDIA", "Priests are the Church's field operatives, often not very bright but always fanatical in their fervour and true to their belief. The Church naturally assumes that everyone worships the Star Gods, which is sometimes a good thing, and sometimes a very bad thing. Be careful, them priests know how to brawl. They are usually former Zealots and might tell us about their trade as well."},
		{"STR_CHURCH_LEADER_UFOPEDIA", "Reverends are lower level spiritual leaders, who have the right to claim that they speak the will of the Star Gods. More refined and richer than ordinary Zealots, they are nevertheless as fanatical and can pose a significant threat. With plenty of foolhardy people and magical powers at their disposal, these make bad enemies. They also have nice refractors, but are otherwise rather easy to take down in close quarters combat. What's curious: they seem to be also interested in the ways of the Old Earth, which seems to be a contradiction to their Star Gods worship..."},
		{"STR_CHURCH_COMMANDER_UFOPEDIA", "These high leaders of The Church are powerful, clever and highly skilled in magics. Commanding entire armies of fanatical warriors, each one of these is worth a fortune, if we manage to capture them. Just look at these robes! Surprisingly however, these hedonistic individuals do not seem to take the Star God worship as seriously as one would expect - like the Star Gods were only convenient idols for them, and fully replaceable."},
		{"STR_APOC_DISCIPLE_UFOPEDIA", "The Disciples might appear like cult leaders, but it is not strictly true; the cult is actually anarchistic in nature and we have learned nothing about any possible high leadership. It is only known that many temples exist, loosely connected by flow of cultists and supplies. In part this is because of secrecy, in part because the cultists do not care much about investigating or understanding. Their eyes have already been opened and they need to know nothing besides the way of the Apocalypse. The Disciples worship all aspects of Apocalypse equally; what sets them apart is their savviness with words, used to convert beggars and kings alike."},
		{"STR_APOC_SADIST_UFOPEDIA", "These guys have joined the Cult of Apocalypse for the sheer love of hurting others. They believe the world should be drowned in the screams of the tormented. Sadists are usually seen as footsoldiers of the Apocalypse. They're strong and tough, but their hoods do somewhat impede their reactions."},
		{"STR_APOC_MARAUDER_UFOPEDIA", "One of the common 'ways of the Apocalypse', undertook by its believers, is to join the 'Legion of Chernobog' and become a faceless warrior, one of many, indifferent to their own death as long as Apocalypse is being raised. In place of their faces, Marauders are granted ocular implants so no enemy can escape their sight. They also carry hidden blades."},
		{"STR_MUTON_SOLDIER_UFOPEDIA", "The Mercenaries are tenacious, lethal and very tough. They do not negotiate with their enemies, so don't expect to get much ransom for their warriors. Even these lower-ranking Mercs are not an enemy to be trifled with, as the companies always recruit new members from mutants with combat experience."},

		{"STR_MUTON_ENGINEER_UFOPEDIA", "The so-called Engineers are a special caste within mercenary companies. Of course, they're fully capable engineers, tending to mercenary ships and weapons. However, in combat, they're far from being pushovers: their custom weapons, camo suits and combat sights make them extremely deadly marksmen. They're also able to see through stealth, spotting your camouflaged units from far away."},
		{"STR_MUTON_HEAVY_UFOPEDIA", "Some of the Mercs, who are too crazy or stupid to be trusted with ranged weapons, wear massive suits of Plastasteel armor and serve as living battering rams, armed with lethal plasma gloves that can destroy pretty much anything in a super-gory fashion. The best practical way of killing them, short of a tactical nuke, is a powerful laser blast to their comparatively thin back plate."},
		{"STR_MUTON_LEADER_UFOPEDIA", "The Mercenary Captains are the elite within an elite; they dedicate their whole lives to mastering all aspects of the art of warfare, from sword fighting through squad tactics to orbital bombardments. While engaging rank-and-file Mercenaries with melee weapons is a viable, if desperate tactic; against these guys, it is strongly unadvised. The Mercenary Captains are also ranking members of the so-called 'Space Rangers', thus linking these two forces together in the Stellar Empire's enforcers' hierarchy."},

Don't let their looks deceive you, these guys have quick reflexes, know how to use their guns and won't break down easily. They are also trained in martial arts, so don't be surprised if they dodge your melee attacks."},
		{"STR_GOVT_PILOT_UFOPEDIA", "Since being allowed to fly a nuclear-powered vessel is considered a major privilege in any Provincial Govt's organization, these guys consider themselves to be elite. Truth be told, despite their buffoonery, they're usually much better specialists than Guild Air Sailors. Watch out for their well-honed reflexes if you actually engage them in ground combat - which is a sure way to offend their masters and upset our politics, by the way."},
		{"STR_GOVT_MP_UFOPEDIA", "Military Police are pretty much the only kind of police most people will ever see. Armed with heavy weapons and riding armored vehicles, or even aircraft, these hard-like-rock men will usually shoot first, ask questions later. None the less, they're govt officers, even if much less valuable than Enforcers or Pilots, so getting in a shootout with them is a political decision."},
		{"STR_GOVT_DETECTIVE_UFOPEDIA", "While the Govts are being encouraged to completely trust Megapol with their policing, they're not dumb enough to actually do so. Without keeping at least some semblance of a civilized society within the poorer communities, these quickly become ruled by gangs and populated by people who owe nothing to the uncaring govts. This ungrateful task of extending law's protection into the slums falls onto those foolish, poorly funded individuals, who usually try to help the disheveled masses at least a bit, despite the world telling them it makes no sense whatsoever. Many of them are corrupt, violent, or addicted to drugs, but they're still much better than Megapol or Highwayman death squads. However, communities which enjoy even this dubious protection of Govt Detectives are few and far between."},

However, they had no trust in Hybrids, and the Rets themselves were willing to share only Sirens and Sectogres. Since Sirens were smarter and sexier, while equally obedient, the govts chose them. The Govt Siren is psionically-boosted, which makes her a dangerous mind-controller, and military training ensures her standard combat skills are adequate as well.

They're a bit better fighters than average Ratlings, especially with the bow and the knife.

Usually they do this to people who have slighted or offended the Ratmen Mafia in some way, like by refusing to pay racket or to honor the Mafia properly. Sometimes, however, SMATs storm houses of random people just to stay sharp. They wear armor that is annoyingly resistant to standard firearms, especially from the front, not giving any chance to shotgun-wielding farmers."},

They're romanticized in popular culture, but not liked by the federal govts. They prefer to use ranged weapons, and possess better training with those than most Bandits, but they're far from harmless in melee. Their leather armors allow them to dodge sloppy blows, as well as provide some protection against most forms of attack, like daze, fire, chem, smoke and cutting - at the price of movement speed."},

It could be just the influence of Megapol, but our interrogations have uncovered something more subtle, their special links to 'Hitmen', these seemingly normal assassins.

Each Hitman has a secret, unique barcode tattoo, which he receives during the annointment ceremony, conducted by a group of senior Brothers. The goals of the organization are vague, but it answers to the mysterious 'Sabbahs'. Their orders generally involve tracking down the influence of the Shadowmasters. Sabbahs coordinate Hitmen actions with Megapol and elements of Govts, where Brotherhood has its agents. The Brotherhood makes use of their customers and allies, especially Highwaymen, to gather intel.

Their prices are relatively high, therefore only serious operations can afford their protection."},

Dextrous with gun and knife, they don't turn down dirty work. Their nomadic and loner nature often leads them to developing strong spirituality, or, as others call it, going cuckoo. It's not a rare occurrence when a Drifter joins some crazy cult or develops taste for sentient flesh; on the other hand, some stabilize enough to join city militias."},

They have no special skills or weaknesses, except for being, on average, not very sharp."},

They are adventuring types, working for town gangs or forming gangs on their own. In these endeavours, they are of the mind that poor guns cannot defeat skillful tackles and headbutts. As such, they're equipped with close combat gear and called upon when a vicious mugging is in order. Many dream of becoming Gravball celebrities."},

In this line of work, requiring climbing, rappelling and running from monsters, armor is usually a hindrance, but Runners wear some protection against melee and chem. They're also in top physical form and trained in stealth and defense against dark magics. Their fancy and expensive equipment grants them NV of 12.

They sometimes conduct 'harvest' raids to replace their failing organs with fresh ones, taken from their victims. They live in small communities, known for their medical and chemical knowledge. The disease they suffer from, apart from disfiguration, decay and horrible smell, also gives them some unique feats - like the ability to regenerate lost health during battle, at the cost of a major strain to their bodies. They're immune to chem and smoke, and resistant to daze, laser and concussion. Their sole weakness is Burn damage, but when they stop burning, they just regenerate back. They see through smoke quite well (ThV: 50%). Better to kill them fast to avoid trouble."},

Then they came into some kind of conflict with the 'Elder Gods', who arrived here from the stars. The Yig were driven underground by global cooling, where they dwell to this day, their numbers greatly diminished but their designs eternal.

Kobolds, a cross between Humans and Lizardmen, are artificially bred in cloning vats, and to ensure they won't run out of control again like Narlocks and Lokk'Naars did, they're all-female.

For lack of a better word, we dubbed them 'Kobolds'. They don't bother with things like civilization or clothing. These hunter-gatherers proudly consider themselves 'Slaves to the Dragon Masters'. That we can tell as far as we understand their ancient dialect, mixed with a language they're calling 'Chtonic', supposedly passed on them by these 'Dragons', or 'Lizardmen' whatever they are.

It must first be processed by microorganisms into digestible compounds, a bridge between its nuclear power and humanlike biochemistry. Our survival requires a whole ecosystem. However, the Zombies contain the whole process within their bodies, and have access to uncanny abilities. These powers, this promise of eternal vitality, tempts many into trying to crossbreed with Zombies, usually by eating them. And it sometimes works, Zombie biology being so infectiously adaptable. The results are chaotic, but the risk of death, madness and mutation doesn't cause a shortage of demand."},

They eat Zombies to gain Zombie-like endurance and prolong their lives - which has, apparently, worked, at the price of making them completely mad. When we started to interrogate one, she seemed to be very attracted to the Brainers, but the untowardly attraction turned out to be more untowardly than we thought - they don't seem to be opposed to the idea of having a fellow Uber as a side dish.

While they succeeded in gaining great resilience, it ultimately caused degeneration. Now they're desperate for every morsel of hellerium-tainted flesh, zombie or otherwise. At least that much we can divine from their barely articulate ramblings. Let it be a lesson to us, because, really, they're useless for anything else."},

It is unclear how the Bandits are able to tame such creatures, but judging by how these small monsters look, maybe it's just a case of misery loving company. The Hounds are adept at surviving on the wastelands and are somewhat resistant to all forms of damage; piercing and concussive weapons seem to work best against them, while smoke, daze and fire are the least effective.

Megapol often helps Govts (or competes with them) to fight all kinds of crime, but its sword is aimed first and foremost against the Black Market.

Also it turns out there are several types of Star Gods; the ones we meet are 'Guides', but there are ones called 'Subduers' as well, who don't have that cool glow effect, cannot turn invisible, and are unable to use Ghost Beams, relying on telekinesis and plasma guns instead.

Well, if it takes another slave in a silly costume for the gals to take their medicine, so be it. With our tested procedure (we knew this would come in handy), we will dress up another slave, tell the gals that he is imbued with Hellerium, and that he can recharge them with his magical smoke.

So we focused on the mechanical aspect and built this really cool bat armor with an extra-strong cape. But... The gals insisted that (a) the armor is obviously a toy, (b) batbuddy didn't have any superpowers, it was all in the armor, only, it clearly isn't, and (c) back armor is useless. One of the brainerz (not me of course) replied that an armored back was perfect for running away with the booty.

Therefore an efficient system for radiating off the heat is needed for long space voyages to prevent the crew from cooking alive. Traditional radiators are impractical due to their huge size. The solution is to have coolant dispersed into fine mist around the ship, trapped in a forcefield and kept circulating. As the surface of radiator decreases relative to fourth power of its temperature increase, it's best to keep it as hot as is bearable."},

This issue is usually mitigated by thick, energized hulls of Star God vessels, but cannot be ignored altogether. We have studied the effects of radiation and devised ways to optimize armor and shield designs to better protect against it."},

Their encryption software is unbreakable, and their compression algorithms approach average 99% size reduction on large amounts of data, making interstellar communications much easier and allowing them to keep entire personas stored digitally on relatively small Optronic crystal matrices. The math involved is truly beyond human understanding, but we have procured a selection of maintenance tools and backdoors to penetrate their locks, and exclusive software that could allow us to run powerful data centres of our own."},

It turned out that orderly superconductive lattices with the right gems used as resistors will do the trick."},
		{"STR_SHIELDS_DYNAMIC_COMPUTING_UFOPEDIA", "Blue Shields do not require massive energy feed, but lots of computational power. Their effectiveness largely hinges on intricate calculations, required to set the barrier to just right resonance frequencies in precise points of time and space. Understanding how to achieve that feat and gain control over this technology, not even really understood by the Academy, was impossible without us grasping at least some general principles of the Divine Code."},
		{"STR_SHIELDS_1_UFOPEDIA", "We have made preliminary observations regarding the nature of this exciting technology. Energy shields take damage before it reaches armor, and their resistances to various forms of it may vary a lot, but they have no armor value themselves. The following damage types ignore energy shields: Charm, Choke, Anti-E511, Heat & Cold. In SHIELDS descriptions, the first number is max capacity, while the other - regen at the start of every our AND enemy turns."},

The ability to mix, match and stack them as needed cannot be underestimated. However, they have a major disadvantage: Burnout. It happens after a set time after activation. If you don't manage to finish the mission before that, a shield will be lost."},

They're able to project or dissipate all sorts of energies, making them useful in both attack and defense. As it turns out, they're just a partial implementation of ship-mounted shields of the Stellar Empire. Such real shields regenerate fast (usually .25% per second), but require bulky machinery. However I think we can devise some simpler, hybrid shields for our own ships, lacking that sort of regeneration, but small enough for their frames. To regenerate them, our ship would have to spend 1 hour undergoing maintenance."},
		{"STR_STARGOD_SHIELDS_UFOPEDIA", "Quite unsurprisingly, the Star Gods know a lot about making shields, and the shields they're using on their own ships are quite on a different level than the cheap knockoffs the Church is tinkering with. Not only are Star God shields more efficient, they have devised a number of support technologies to further enhance their potency. Most of the physics involved is far too arcane to understand, much less learned from an interrogation, but I think we have gained the understanding of at least one useful bit; with enough technological base of our own, we'll be able to devise shield recharging systems small enough to fit our miniature craft."},
		{"STR_SUBSPACE_UFOPEDIA", "To actually travel through a 'Black Hole', instead of being destroyed by it, Star God vessels enter a sort of a parallel dimension, called 'Subspace'. It is said to somehow exist outside of normal spacetime, and thus allows far greater speeds than normal FTL jumps. On the downside, you cannot enter it without a pair of 'Jump Gates', each utilizing a 'Black Hole'. Also, it is never certain when the gate can be opened and how long will the travel take."},

Then it suddenly crops up in a visible place. Or not. The Academy would call it perception bias. The humans of Old Earth knew better, though. They called it Wave/Particle Duality. Everything is an object and a wave at the same time. Particles of light are going along ALL possible paths, SIMULTANEOUSLY. Only when you look closer, they start to obey conventional laws again. Thus, everything and everyone is everywhere and nowhere until caught in the act. Madness? Yes, but it is the truth! Just think of the endless possibilities!"},

This technology has many applications - from dynamically-conductive coolants, to polymorphic liquids that can rapidly assume any shape in reaction to a magnetic field, to even things like liquid armor that can dissipate thermal and kinetic energy, leaving no openings or weak spots, and opening up when needed. This technology doesn't seem to be fully grasped by our sources, but nonetheless we learned a lot."},
		{"STR_TRACTORS_AND_REPULSORS_UFOPEDIA", "An important technological secret of the Stellar Empire, Tractor and Repulsor Beams are used to either pull or push mass without any physical contact, often at large ranges and stupendous scales.

We're quite sure that with enough base knowledge, we'll be able to replicate this technology for our own, nefarious needs."},
		{"STR_PHASE_SHIELD_UFOPEDIA", "Perhaps the most exotic and arcane of Star God technologies, it is based on the strange 'phase-shift' effect, where something can exist in our reality, but yet, not quite so. When applied to individuals, a phase shield can make them invisible and intangible to most weapons, while perfectly able to shoot back. It still cannot fool motion scanners or psionic detection, though. When applied to a craft, the results are less spectacular, effectively amounting to a major boost of shield strength."},
		{"STR_ETHEREAL_TRAVEL_UFOPEDIA", "While the Jump Drive is the way through which the Star Gods run their Empire, they deeply abhor the chaotic nature of that technology. They prefer travelling alone or in small groups, at sublight speeds, inside a bubble of psychic energy that separates them from the ravages of the void. Such travels take hundreds thousands of years, but the immortal Star Gods do not mind. They take nothing with them, but huge amounts of compressed information. They create everything they need after arriving."},

Our sources claim it came to Earth from a mysterious place called 'Dimension X', where a race of hyper-advanced aliens dwells. Not much is known either about these beings nor how this technology really works, except for two things; firstly, it is the principle of operation of portals and Disruptor (Purple) Shields; secondly, some aspects of it can be recreated using mystical powers, if one can achieve proper attunement. This is how Reticulans manage to employ it, and, as rumor says, it's also why Star Gods nor their followers will never be able to."},
		{"STR_ADVANCED_WEAPONS_LOCKING_MECHANISM_UFOPEDIA", "An absurd amount of work went into securing Stellar Empire weapons from 'unauthorized' use. The scientific part of it is likely trivial to the Star Gods, but mind-boggling to us; the whole gun is intertwined with molecular strands of a complex quantum computer, which monitors all kinds of biodata of the user yet seems crucial for the functioning of the firing mechanism via some exotic-physics means. Access codes are kept in a 'data cloud' on Holonet and receive constant 'updates'. Obviously we want to keep away from the Holonet. Overall, this problem seems not worth the effort until we gather more info."},

		{"STR_PSI_UNLOCK_UFOPEDIA", "It turned out that the Stellar Empire's weapons - like Plasma guns - operate on pure magic. I mean, not exactly operate, but to use or otherwise tamper with them, one needs to bond with the weapon on a magical level.

To help them out, we can start the 'Human-Reticulan Cooperation' project. The downsides are several - first, we need to do this work for free, second, the govts will protect the Reticulans and push some Faction traffic out of business, leading to less loot, third, it might make the govts more dangerous if we cross them...

We've found some technical expertise developed by X-COM, chiefly that of nuclear-powered laser weapons that had practically unlimited energy supply.

Having no other recourse, we've forced some Lokk'Naar merchants to talk (-200 score); to our chagrin, they knew very little themselves - the Cloaking Devices are being given to them at secret dropoff points, coordinates being sent to them by unknown benefactors.

They're not very happy with their limited power, and the existence of pirates like us is beneficial to them, as it undermines the dominance of the global factions. But if we attack their ships and officers directly, it won't be popular. On the other hand, getting our hands on their stuff has its obvious, immediate benefits. The third group are the poor masses, on whom the Mutant Alliance is based - an influential force within the local governments, a 'civil' face of the opposition towards the rule of the Star Gods, and also our allies of convenience... as long as we're convenient to them.

But maybe you have your eyes on something bigger, Cap'n? Earth's factions will always have immensely more resources than we do, and they will never let us into their elite club. But if we did the impossible and prepared a direct strike against the Solar Governor, we could - only theoretically - hijack its control network and climb to a different level altogether. If you're bold enough, here's the checklist: first of all, security codes procured from an Academy's Provost, Trader Guildmaster, Church Cardinal and, well Star God Coordinator (some of those might require indepth interrogation). Secondly, a big space ship to take us to Mars, which means top-tier shipbuilding and life support systems expertise. It is a short list, true.

Any material object is a quantum wave, and it is impossible to pinpoint its exact speed and position at the same time. The drive spirits the ship away from the observable universe, therefore making its position uncertain. Then the ship can reappear anywhere. The insane part is, it is impossible to tell where and when exactly it will reappear, and how much time it will take. Only if no observer of both its departure and arrival exists, can the ship reappear without creating a time paradox. Thus the longer distance one travels, the more predictable it is.

After a preliminary wave of Escorts, Gunships and Fighters, the dreaded Bombers are sent to impose fear, or, if the need arises, deliver oblivion to their hapless victims.

Pacification features scouting and fly-bys by Fighters and Escorts, and when the areas of unrest are pinpointed, Gunships, Terror Ships and Envoys deliver elite troops to deal with the offenders on the ground, with extreme prejudice. Success of such missions will decrease our notoriety, but we can try beating them up until they relent."},

Specimens of local sentient races are ambushed and stunned, to be carried off into space. Usually the utmost care is taken to not overtly damage the prisoner, and escape unseen.

As you know, the local governments balance between cooperating with the big factions (and by extension, the Star Gods) and respecting the needs of the population and the voice of the Mutant Alliance. Here, a faction aims at coercing (i.e. threatening) one or another local govt into being 'tough on crime' and taking more direct steps against felons like us. Our enemies are the big Factions, and by extension, the Star Gods themselves, so you can bet on the targeted local govt to eventually succumb, sever any ties with us and stop paying us protection money - forever. Our best shot at stopping this is shooting down the Courier with dignitaries. If this fails, the mission will succeed."},
		{"STR_ALIEN_BASE_UFOPEDIA", "Sometimes, the factions build underground bases in secluded areas of the planet, where they can perform any activity that's best left unknown to the population at large (and their competition). However, this secluded location gives us an opportunity to strike, loot the place and disappear into the sunset before massive reinforcements can arrive. On the other hand, each existing Secret Base steadily undermines our position (-10 Infamy daily). A Secret Base is bound to be filled with loot, information (which we can use to blackmail people and otherwise increase our global standing), and is a prime place to look for the highest-ranking members of a faction. The final stages of building a base are signified with massed Supply Ship, Frigate and Cruiser activity that lasts for a couple of days. Enemy Hideouts can't be detected by radar, it requires anchoring for a few hours within less than 1600 NM from the target."},
		{"STR_ALIEN_TERROR_UFOPEDIA", "These 'surgical raids' against 'terrorist leaders' are a sad reality of our times. From time to time, a faction sends its death squads to one city or another to, as it turns out from our interrogation, 'cull the mutant numbers a little as they're breeding too fast anyway'. We can thwart such an attempt early, simply by shooting Terror Ships down, but waiting out and making a surprise appearance at the party can potentially garner us more respect (unless we let too many locals die). In some cases, attackers don't use ships and come by land instead. In such events, the Mutant Alliance will dispatch a Hyperwave distress call. Whether we care about the hapless fools who get massacred or not, it's always an opportunity to grab some loot and fame."},
		{"STR_ALIEN_RETALIATION_UFOPEDIA", "If we shoot down someone's shippings, they will send their man'o'wars looking for us. Our ships are employing cloaking technology, and the hideouts are - well, hidden, but with enough luck and effort they can still be discovered, especially those which are used to launch interceptions. Our enemies are likely to fail and make idiots of themselves anyway, but if they don't, expect them to arrive numerous and armed to the teeth. On the bright side, if we kick their asses, their policy is to cover the failure up and they won't return anytime soon. A Crackdown is performed by ships like Sentries, Fighters, Gunships and Cruisers. If any of them manages to get within about 100 miles from our hideout, expect a landing ship coming fast at it very soon. There are 5 variants of these ships, and some will break easily through any feasible AA defenses, but once the enemy gets boots on the ground, the advantage is ours. The enemy will only be able to deploy in Hangars and the Access Lift."},
		{"STR_ALIEN_SUPPLY_UFOPEDIA", "Wherever a Secret Base exists, it needs to be constantly supplied. Tracking a supply run to its landing zone is a sure-fire way to find a Secret Base. We should be wary, though: the owners know that their flights are easily predicted, and have made precautions against thieves. They will fight to the death, knowing that their ship is rigged to explode, if they cannot defeat the enemy swiftly enough."},
		{"STR_MISSION_FREIGHT_UFOPEDIA", "The Traders' Guild is the biggest cargo transporting company by far, constantly moving stuff around the planet. They not only maintain their own supply chain, but also take a lot of government contracts for moving the least-to-moderately important stuff. So many Freighters are operating at once that the Guild cannot protect them all, and they're not very well armed themselves, so consider them fair game! Just think about all the expensive stuff inside, waiting for us. Freighters have moderately big crews, but they're mostly weak and cowardly, so we should just capture and sell them. However, Freighters rarely land in the wilderness, so we need to shoot them down else they'll land in cities, out of our reach."},
		{"STR_MISSION_HEAVY_FREIGHT_UFOPEDIA", "In response to increasing danger to their trade routes (in no small part due to us), the Guild decided to step up their defensive measures. From now on, we can expect the amount of normal traffic to decrease, in favour of Heavy Freighter flights. The presence of such imposing vessels is sure to increase the perception of the Guild's power, thus each successful mission of this type will cost us -500 points of Infamy."},

After a few fly-bys of Gunboats, an armored Freighter will appear, filled with very valuable cargo. It won't land in any accessible location, so our only chance to get the loot is to shoot it down. However, if we shoot down the Gunboats first, the flight might be canceled, so we gotta be careful."},

		{"STR_MISSION_COURIER_UFOPEDIA", "Academy, Guild and Church sometimes need to transport important people and parcels quickly. Such courier missions are usually performed using small, fast ships, which have little in the way of defense but are so fast that catching up with them could be a problem. Still, if we do manage to do so, they are pretty much defenseless, both in the air and on the ground. Such ships are good opportunities to find rare goods and valuable prisoners. However, if we shoot down their escorts, the courier run might be canceled."},
		{"STR_MISSION_CONVERSION_UFOPEDIA", "The so-called Conversion Missions are one of the staple operations of the Church. Once they hear a rumour of a community whose level of faith is unsatisfactory, they get to work. First, they send out Gunships to pinpoint the offenders and subdue any resistance. Once this phase is completed, Shrine Ships appear to perform the usual shock and awe faith-strengthening procedure. In this latter phase, the Church is more vulnerable to our attacks. On the other hand, successful Conversions lower people's belief in things like Pirates, which is not good."},
		{"STR_MISSION_SUPERVISION_UFOPEDIA", "From time to time, the Star Gods show up on Earth to keep the tabs on current goings-on and ensure no one is breaking their rules. Their ways are always mysterious, as their vessels do not make landings during this mission; either they have means of supervising without direct contact (after all, they have many spies), or they're simply not that much interested in this backwater planet. The Supervisions are flown by Messengers, Envoys and Cruisers."},
		{"STR_MISSION_PASSENGER_UFOPEDIA", "Passenger flights are mainly operated by the Traders Guild, but Academicians also maintain their own, smaller network. Most ordinary purebloods that need to travel buy tickets from them. Such flights are performed by cheap, insignificant ships that pose little danger to us. If we shoot down one such vessel, we can expect to fight many people, but most of them aren't much of a threat. However there is one fine point: do not expect such an attack to be particularly popular if you slaughter and capture civilians (Trader personnel is free game). Passenger ships land mostly in cities, so it's often required to shoot them down to get them."},
		{"STR_MISSION_SURVEY_UFOPEDIA", "Survey missions are conducted by The Academy to monitor all sorts of activities on Earth, ranging from vegetation to human activity. During these missions they gather samples of plants, animals and people to conduct experiments on them. They also abduct any local mages they can find. We can ignore these missions, as they don't hurt us at all, but on the other hand we can take these ships down and take them apart, so why not do so?"},
		{"STR_MISSION_DIPLOMACY_UFOPEDIA", "The Academy, The Guild and the Church need to maintain close ties to the govts - or more like, keep the govts under their thumb. Diplomatic missions are crucial to this, and they are conducted periodically. They represent little threat to us, but they are an opportunity to capture someone important. Shooting down the escorts makes it very likely for the mission to be canceled, so maybe we should wait for the Courier?"},
		{"STR_MISSION_MERCENARY_ASSIGNMENT_UFOPEDIA", "The Mercenaries conduct their dirty business all year long. Generally they're of little threat to us... unless we cross them. They fly deadly vessels like Heavy Gunships or Frigates and are armed to the teeth. Shooting down any of these ships, even if successful, is assured to have repercussions."},
		{"STR_MISSION_RAID_UFOPEDIA", "Raids are usually organized by Raiders, sometimes by Spartans. They normally choose targets that are away from any settlements, preferably defenseless peasants. Raid parties rarely have good weapons, but they make up for this with numbers and tenacity. Killing raiders isn't enormously profitable, but everybody has to start somewhere, right? At least the chance of Raiders mounting a Crackdown mission in response is very low; it can only happen if they happen to have very powerful friends."},

Nekomimi managed to make them far more stealthy, fast and maneuverable than they have any right to be. Armaments consist of plasma cannons, countless fighters and nuclear warheads."},

They are established by Mobile Fortresses, launched from the safety of Jillsville, and also feature flights of their Seekers and Jetfighters. Destroying a Mobile Fortress (easily recognized by a huge, very slow radar blip) quickly enough can stop this mission, but Ninjas claim such a feat is impossible. The first stage of their Hideout is an Airfield, and it is protected by flights of three Jetfighters. It can be told from Faction bases by its huge detection range. It will take Ninjas 6-18 months to upgrade it to a bigger and nastier base. Enemy Hideouts can't be detected by radar, it requires anchoring for a few hours within less than 1600 NM from the target."},

Their construction is executed by Crawlers, accompanied by APCs, Jetfighters and a Seeker. An Outpost is a small Ninja Base, but it's still difficult to assault. It is protected by flights of Jetbikes and costs us -5 Infamy daily. Enemy Hideouts can't be detected by radar, it requires anchoring for a few hours within less than 1600 NM from the target."},

A telltale sign is a Seeker, which can detect our craft and bases from very far away due to the accursed Ninja technology. Ninja attacks are very dangerous and usually are performed on foot, so they're impossible to intercept and can only be stopped by base defenses."},
		{"STR_BLACKMARCH_UFOPEDIA", "The inhabitants of this country are known for their combat mettle and fierce pride. They prefer rural life, as large cities tend to draw heavy artillery fire. Same goes for organized infrastructure - forest pathways and animal transport make poor targets for bombing. Many have taken the locals for unwashed and uneducated primitives, which appears to be only partly true, as the country has not only held off several invasions through their combination of guerrilla warfare and expert military training, but was even able to expand its territories, and it could perhaps become a major power if not for the locals' very vocal distrust in any form of peacetime government or their inability to conform to any non-military rules or regulations. Only two cities can be found in this land - sprawling Free City where the locals convene to form their Parliament, and an imposing fortress, The Bastion, serving as a bulwark against Bad Things that dwell in the south."},
		{"STR_CALIFORNIA_REPUBLIC_UFOPEDIA", "Known for its peculiar political system, called 'democracy', as well as for being the world's leading power in movie production. Their ruler, called a 'President', is always chosen by the general vote (voting is easy, as all TV sets have touchscreens) from the most popular movie stars in a monthly poll; the poll also decides what to do with the former president, a popular choice being 'death on the stage' (the local movie industry prides itself in that no effects are faked). In this land of the free, there is no police and little government, so order is enforced by highly fanatical death-squads of a fully hermetic (through the feat of inbreeding) Hubbologist Order. It is only natural that the leaders of this organization, engaged in such ungrateful and hard work take two-thirds of everyone else's earnings. After all, they don't revere Dollar the Almighty for nothing."},
		{"STR_CENTRAL_PROVINCE_UFOPEDIA", "With almost a hundred million citizens, the Central Province is the most populous country on the planet. Its rulers boast about their unshakeable loyalty to the Empire. Their belief is that rule of the superiors over inferiors is the divine order of things, and when the Star Gods arrived, it was only natural to pledge allegiance. They also claim that their land is the most beloved by the Star Gods. The question if the Star Gods can feel any love remains open, but there's no doubt the Central Province has been loved quite roughly and thoroughly; most of it is a cratered death zone, rendered uninhabitable by chemical, biological and nuclear contamination, not even mentioning strange monsters and other, bizarre and unexplained phenomena. Less influenced areas (which doesn't mean safe) are inhabited by dirt-poor peasants, struggling to harvest enough rice to feed relatively more fortunate inhabitants of underground cities. Strangely, the locals do not complain too much, maybe because complaining can make you an organ donor."},
		{"STR_CONFEDERATION_UFOPEDIA", "The Confederation is the bread basket of the world, their humongous agriculture powered by equally humongous numbers of slaves (their main import and close to 80% of the population). No effort was spared (including unsurprisingly many, many slaves' lives) to learn how to domesticate (and turn profit on) vicious forms of fauna and flora like Cowyotes, Tentacle Vines or Carnocorn. With the passage of centuries, the success, as the plantation owners agree over a glass of the finest moonshine, has been spectacular. The Confederation has no real central government other than a loose board of the wealthiest grandees, but they're rich enough to buy the best guns and mercenaries, and the free people, for the lack of daily burdens, are all well trained in combat. And perhaps most importantly, each of the Confederation's neighbors currently has too much on their own plate to think about invading, with the possible exception of the Latin Empire."},
		{"STR_DARK_DOMINION_UFOPEDIA", "This country is ruled by a shadowy council of eight Masked Mages. The population, numbering over 70 million, is considerably well off, living mostly in small towns and agricultural communities. The wealth of the country, both in tech and money, is pretty considerable. So why such an ominous name, a child would ask? The Mages, backed by a huge, fanatical cult, openly worship what they call the 'Dark Gods'. And the ways of worship are many - starting with a huge number of taboos (like the ban on motorized vehicles), naturally punished by a painful death, ending with, what else, mass human sacrifices. Strangely enough, this system seems to be working, as the Deep Ones do not bother locals too much, and even the Church of Sirius usually avoids these parts of the planet. Aside from their strange religion and dark magics, the Dominion is known for its mastery in production of various mind-altering drugs, both widely used by the locals and exported abroad (if the Mages allow)."},
		{"STR_DEATH_REALMS_UFOPEDIA", "Names are often misleading. But not in this case. The whole country is a blasted wasteland that's out to kill you. The wildlife consists of giant, poisonous scorpions, giant, poisonous spiders, giant, poisonous plants... you're probably starting to see the pattern. And if you avoid those, there is always plentiful and deadly UV radiation. There are four heavily fortified cities that host close to 20 million population. Not to be outdone by the local nature, the rulers devised an ingenious way to simultaneously deal with overcrowding, low morale, poverty and scarcity of food supplies: televised death games, played either in death arenas, death mazes, death pits or plainly on city streets. The participants are chosen at random. There is big money to be won (and being rich means food and clean air), but most of the contestants end up murdered (extra points are rewarded for creative kills) and thrown into nutrient-recycling vats. Somehow, few outsiders show any interest in this merry land."},
		{"STR_EURASIAN_AUTONOMY_UFOPEDIA", "Since this area of the world stood the most defiant against the Star Gods invasion, it has been thoroughly brutalized by both the Gods and their human proxies. After a hundred years or so of not-entirely-successful operation, the Star Gods finally called it quits and left the few remaining local survivors to their own devices. The modern day EA is a part of the Star Gods province system, but, while basically a non-actor on the international scene, with the leadership corrupted by one or another foreign power, it has a reputation of a 'land where nothing can be done' - doing business there is subjecting yourself to endless delays, incompetence, robbery, shoddy workmanship, unforeseen difficulties and so on... Strangely, all the attempts of civilizing this seemingly weak country ended in tears, up to and including mysterious explosions of atomic bombs, which, supposedly, were all long since scrapped by the Star Gods."},
		{"STR_EUROSYNDICATE_UFOPEDIA", "An industrial and technological powerhouse with over 80 million citizens, this corporate state is the wealthiest on the planet, hampered as it might be by infighting and the universal ban on global travel all local govts have to adhere to. While Europe bore the brunt of a nuclear war fought in the early days of Star Gods occupation, the Eurosyndicate rose from the ashes, building enclosed cities with intricate filtration systems and virtual reality networks. Food is grown in great underground caverns and is reportedly quite edible. That's all perhaps enough to sweeten universal debt-slavery and incessant shootouts between police, corporate forces and criminals (in varied configurations), none of whom care too much about collateral damage. The elites live in luxury, surrounded by their famous gen-engineered servants and infamous cybernetic hitmen, and quietly dream about dominating the globe."},
		{"STR_FUSO_UFOPEDIA", "Whatever international standing Fuso has comes only from its rich and sprawling capitol of Sunrise, where most of its technology and wealth is concentrated under the watchful eye of the Emperor and a host of industrial cartels. But their power ends about a dozen paces off the city limits, and the rest of this scarcely populated land is torn by incessant warfare between local warlords, over the years relying more and more on medieval weapons because ammo costs money. Average locals haven't even heard of electricity. Unsurprisingly, the country is mostly known for its swords, martial arts and ars moriendi."},
		{"STR_GHOSTGATES_UFOPEDIA", "Rumours say the country is haunted, and if you take a wrong turn, you could find a vampire or worse. Legend has it, just after conquering the Earth, the Star Gods had to curb excess population levels of that time, so they resettled billions of people from the whole Eurasia onto the isolated subcontinent, only to destroy them with a host of nasty plagues, some killing outright, some causing slow agony, some putting people in a death-like state or doing even more bizarre things. While the notion that there could ever be a billion people living on the planet (let alone multiple billions) seems a bit of a stretch, Ghostgates is definitely spooky, with its endless old boneyards and ruins, scattered throughout lush jungles, and its silent, big-eyed inhabitants, living in dozens of disparate counties and towns. Not to mention that the five aristocratic families of old, who have the right to elect the local Patriarch, could well be the vampires of legend judging by their looks and decadence."},
		{"STR_HIDDEN_EXPANSE_UFOPEDIA", "The African continent was very rich and populous in the ages of yore, but all that ended with the Deep Ones invasion. The chaos they brought emboldened the local wild Reticulan tribes and attracted all kinds of freaks of nature, insane enough to worship the Deep Ones' gods (which might be less dangerous than the Star Gods, probably, but are certainly much crazier). The 15 or so million people who still hold on to this rump of a state are well-fortified, determined and never far from their flamethrowers and artillery pieces. Those who can afford it, generally flee, usually to find disenchantment abroad - despite all the danger, it is said that the Knight-Generals who rule the Hidden Expanse keep reasonable order, with the execution rate almost on par with the homicide rate, which is a feat by itself."},

		{"STR_IRON_TRIBE_UFOPEDIA", "While this important, if largely depopulated country can hardly be called a tribe nowadays, the origin of the name can be traced several centuries back, when the isles housed nothing but stone-age tribes. The Iron Tribe had some pre-invasion tech, great ambitions and unmatched tenacity, and, because of that, there eventually were no other tribes anymore. The nation grew rich enough to restore some electrical grid and steam train service - low tech but nonetheless amazing feats. Most of the population is dispersed throughout fortified villages, separated by large swathes of foreboding wilderness, but for their capitol, the Iron Tribe reclaimed the ancient city of Spectral... which was quite a bold move, as the haunted ruins host a huge, mysterious and seemingly indestructible (not for the lack of trying) transdimensional gate. There is regularly something unspeakable coming out of it and doing unspeakable things. The well-organized (if lacking heavy equipment) military is usually able to eventually repel such guests, but none of many expeditions sent through the gate ever returned."},

Quite nice people, actually, until they stone you to death for smoking tobacco or exposing your thighs in public.

Other than that, a boring place."},

The government tries to manage with what limited resources they have, thus they're enforcing strict population limits. The locals are not really supposed to complain, else they might well be expelled from this heavily-policed paradise on earth and find themselves on the other side of the border. Multiple layers of barbed wire, interlocking minefields and automated machinegun emplacements, set to shoot anything that moves, make sure that said border is somewhat harder to traverse in the opposite direction."},
		{"STR_RED_REVOLUTION_UFOPEDIA", "Yet another country run by religious whackos, this time having nothing to do with the Star Gods cult, though. The Church of the Red Revolution reveres a prophetic-like figure, Marx Guevara, who is said to have been martyred in between two hundred - two hundred thousand years ago (depending on scripture) and is supposed to come back to deliver all the Revolutionists from evil, and send all the other people to an eternity of creative torment. This joyous event is supposed to happen any day now. Meanwhile the Revolutionists are busy implementing the tenets of their religion (abolition of private property, simple living, helping each other and unquestioningly following orders of the priesthood), chasing sinners (who are then, naturally, subjected to creative cruelty) and frantically arming themselves - not long ago this land was contested between the Latin Empire and the Confederation."},
		{"STR_ROGUE_FIELDS_UFOPEDIA", "This deserted country is divided between a dozen rich, powerful and bombastic warlords, each keeping his own army. While the clashes between those 'Lords of War' as they call themselves, are pretty commonplace, they are united by a common interest: piracy. Large fleets of flying and seaborne ships are ready to strike any country which lowers its guard and run away, cargo bays filled with loot and slaves, before the smoke begins to clear - only to later trade the spoils on the global market, not infrequently to the former owners. The wealth of gold, tech and weapons thus gathered over centuries, along with the geography, protects the Lords from any meaningful retribution, not even mentioning mundane threats like the Deep Ones. The Lords are, naturally, tyrannical, but the locals follow the 'live fast, die young' motto, and when there is no war, ride in the great death-races that are the biggest sports events on the planet. There is no shortage of motorized vehicles either, as the Rogue Fields is the world's top producer of oil-burning machinery, riding, sailing or flying."},
		{"STR_ROMANICA_UFOPEDIA", "The most iconic features of the landscape are numerous stone castles, from small keeps to sprawling fortresses, fortified with every known weapon, up to intercontinental missiles. These castles are ancestral homes to numerous aristocratic families, jointly ruling the land, often clashing, sometimes even warring with each other. The country is mostly deforested and dusty, but still contains huge swathes of agriculture, farmed by local peasants who are often reasonably well off (that is, until some clashing faction sets their houses on fire), but are forbidden to possess any advanced technology. The capital, Ground Zero, is mostly neutral zone where the landlords meet to discuss general politics; the families might often hate each other, but they hate the neighboring countries even more. The capital's name comes from the old tale, that during the nuclear war, an ancient city that stood there was hit by the first and biggest warhead of mass destruction. Hardly any ruins remain, and today's city is a place of numerous luxury entertainment establishments."},
		{"STR_STEEL_PACT_UFOPEDIA", "For centuries, the western coastline of South America was home to half-a-dozen piss-poor tiny states, clinging to what little they could harvest from the sea and protected from the Amazonian Deep Ones by the mountains. Those mountains couldn't protect them from the tsunami waves that utterly devastated the tiny states, or from the Dark Dominion which quickly capitalized on its neighbors' bad luck by invading them. However, one Commandante Bolivar rose as head of the resistance, and then as head of the alliance, when the occupiers were thrown out. A master of propaganda, he managed to turn this backwater into a land of belching low-tech factories and united nationalistic fervour. It is obvious that the godless Dark Dominion is responsible for all the bad things that happened. Huge contingents of steel tanks and men in black uniforms stand ready to confront the Dominion's superior technology with superior numbers, dedication and tactics. The war can break out at any moment now, especially after everyone suspected of jeopardizing the country's effort, their families and their dogs are exterminated."},
		{"STR_TECHNOCRACY_UFOPEDIA", "Little is known of the inner workings of the Technocracy, as almost no one leaves the country - and those who do are as clueless as outsiders, speaking of a life in sprawling industrial cities, amongst masses of zombie-like compatriots. There is no question though that the Technocracy is big on all things cybernetic, from surveillance systems to outright robots and cyborgs. As the rulers of the country seem to be completely silent to the outside world, the vision of endless armies of automata setting out some day to conquer the planet is a popular scare in the neighboring lands. However, such an event has yet to happen, and the general consensus is that the Technocracy is ears-deep in internal trouble, caused by social unrest, the heavy tithes the Star Gods demand, and, if you're willing to listen to wilder rumors, by rogue machines."},
		{"STR_THEBAN_TYRANNY_UFOPEDIA", "Not much was happening in this desert country, inhabited by what remained of local Arabic peoples (estimated 95% extinction) until a ruler rose virtually out of the desert sands about two centuries ago. Known as Queen Bee, and styling herself as 'Cleopatra', she imposed her rule with the help of an extremely powerful battlemage (both of them are said to surpass even the Star Gods in sorcery), and kept herself and her most valuable servants alive and youthful through the means of arcane biotechnology. Said biotechnology was also used to breed whole armies of drone soldiers and workers (this not-too-keen-on-thinking crowd now constitutes most of the population) to subjugate surrounding areas. A sole, huge city of Thebes was built in the Nile Valley, and its absolute mistress, sitting on the top of the Silver Pyramid, has her eyes on new conquests... An eventual clash with the currently leading local power, the Eurosyndicate, seems inevitable, meanwhile the rulers of Romanica frantically arm themselves and prepare for the worst."},
		{"STR_TURAN_UFOPEDIA", "The endless, scarcely populated expanses of Central Asia turned out to be cost prohibitive for even the Star Gods to control.  Consequently, the areas stayed mostly untouched by the globe-wide devastation. About three centuries ago a coherent power coalesced out of local nomadic peoples: Turan. Keeping to themselves (both figuratively and literally, as they expertly scavenge whatever technology and servants they can) in this chaotic world, they built a society based on simple, harsh yet relatively just laws, ruled by the strongest warlord from the fortress-city of Karakorum. Most of the population still keeps to their nomadic ways of life, often wandering past Crossroads as far as Romanica to feed their herds and trade. Reputed as fierce warriors, they really don't appreciate strangers meddling in their affairs. Like, head-on-a-pike not appreciate. If you don't offend them, though, they're quite hospitable, they'll feed you and tend to your injuries, just don't be surprised to find yourself relieved of all possessions."},
